Question 1.
1.	Prompt the user to enter the principal amount (p).
2.	Prompt the user to enter the interest rate (r).
3.	Prompt the user to enter the period (t).
4.	Convert the interest rate (r) from a percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100 and assigning it to a variable (s).
5.	Set A = p * (1 + s * t).
6.	Print A.

Question 2.
1.	Prompt the user to input the principal amount (p).
2.	Prompt the user to input the interest rate (r).
3.	Prompt the user to input the period (t).
4.	Prompt the user to input the number of times interest is compounded (n).
5.	Set A = p * (1 + (r/n))**(n*t).
6.	Print A.

Question 3.
1.	Prompt the user to input the period
2.	Prompt the user to input the interest rate (r).
3.	Prompt the user to input the time period (t).
4.	Prompt the user to input the number of payments (n).
5.	Calculate the total number of payments (N) as N = n * t.
6.	Calculate the interest rate per payment (R) as R = r / n.
7.	Calculate the value of (1 + R) raised to the power of N and store it in variable (P) as P = (1 + R) ** N.
8.	Calculate the annuity factor (A) using the formula A = (P - 1) / R.
9.	Print A.
